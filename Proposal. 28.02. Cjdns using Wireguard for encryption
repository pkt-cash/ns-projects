## Project summary ##
Create a cjdns wireguard for encryption in the PKT network. PKT ecosystem includes a special broadcasting network and a protocol, that can be used for building decentralized VPN services and Web 3.0. PKT team is going to create a worldwide online community of PKT protocol adopters and unite all supporters of decentralized web. Also PKT is a bandwidth market based on cjdns protocol, which rewards its members for bandwidth delegation. 

## Project deliverables ##
This project will deliver:
* Contributions to existing software: https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns
Note on delivery: the team 
* would plan to set up the software development process in two week long spring
* would be ready to discuss the current spring results and plans for next sprint every two weeks with the Stewards and other stakeholders



## Success criteria ##

Verify that wireguard encryption mechanism is complete and ready to launch.

## Milestones ##
Creation of cjdns encryption wireguard. Here are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

### Milestone 0: Kickoff
At the beginning of the project, the Network Steward will pay out 8M of PKT to the applicant.

### Milestone 1: Modification of cjdns ##
Modification of cjdns build to allow inclusion of Rust code in the codebase - accepted in mainline cjdns

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 8M of PKT will be paid out.

### Milestone 2: Demo cjdns connection ##
Version of cjdns using cloudflare BoringTUN based WireGuard encryption, demo two cjdns instances connecting - accepted in mainline cjdns. Features expected to be completed include:

* New version number for cjdns which uses BoringTUN when possible, falls back on CryptoAuth for communicating with older cjdns instances

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 8M of PKT will be paid out.

## Legal

The applicant understands that the network steward is not a legal entity and no part of this
project constitutes any form of legal agreement. The applicant accepts that the network steward
exists thanks to the effort of volunteers and the applicant has no reasonable expectation of any
action, payment or communication from the network steward at any time. For their part, the
applicant has no binding commitment or obligation at any time as a result of their participation
in this project.
