## Project summary

Currently, there exists a chat software for the PKT community at [http://pkt.chat](http://pkt.chat). It is browser-based, but users can install the Mattermost mobile app to connect with it.

However, with the base Mattermost chat app,  push notifications are not supported, so users arenâ€™t alerted when someone messages them.

We would like to implement the push notification system that will enable smartphone users to to receive these notifications, improving the user experience of the PKT chat ecosystem.

## Team and Past Work

The team includes [Christofer Koutelieris](mailto:soricine@gmail.com) and [Adonis Gaitatzis](http://github.com/backupbrain). Christopher and Adonis have both worked on PKT mobile software for iOS before an as-yet-unreleased software, and Adonis has worked directly on the PKT blockchain as well as the VPN Utility project, the Telegram trading bot, and the PKT price ticker.

Examples of past open-source contributions by team members are as follows:

**Christofer Koutelieris**
Is:

* [x] The lead maintainer of the software
* [ ] A regular contributor to the software
* [ ] An occasional contributor to the software
* [x] Not a contributor yet

_Has only work on closed source projcets up until this point_

**Adonis Gaitatzis**

## Project Deliverables

When the project is complete, we will deliver to the pkt.cash operators:

-   A working push-notification server configuration
-   A PKT-branded Android APK and source code
-   A PKT-branded iOS IPA and source code

These deliverables are broken down by milesstone, so time and cost will be addressed for each deliverable in its corresponding milestone.

The project includes sensitive information including private keys, which should not be revealed to the public. Therefore our deliverables must be handed over to a verified pkt.cash operator rather than open source to the public.

## Success criteria

At the end of this project, we will have:

-   Push notification service running that enables PKT chat users to receive message alerts on their smartphones when they are not using the app.

-   PKT-branded Android and iOS Mattermost apps, which interact with the PKT chat server and the push proxy.

## Milestones

1.  Push Notification Software
2.  Push Notification service running online
3.  Customize and build Android app
4.  Customize and build iOS app

### Milestone 0 (Kickoff)

We have found the Mattermost instructions for deploying a push notification server, including testing the mobile app on an Android smartphone.

### Milestone 1

#### Push notification software running on a server

At this step we will have the Mattermost push notification software running on a server, but will not be yet connected to a public website.

Estimated time: 15 hours
Estimated cost: 1020 EUR

After delivery, we will be able to demonstrate by screenshot that the push notification is running in console.

### Milestone 2

#### Push notification software running on a server

At this step we will connect a web server, likely NGINX to the Mattermost push proxy software, so that the push proxy can operate on the public Internet over secure HTTPS.

Estimated time: 15 hours
Estimated cost: 1020 EUR

After delivery, a lay person wil be able to visit the web server and display a simple  "Mattermos push proxy" web site. Additionally we expect to be able to send test notifications into the server using the `curl` program.

### Milestone 3

#### PKT-branded Android App

At this step we will have an unsigned APK file that we can distribute for testing which is securely connected to the Mattermost proxy server and which uses PKT-themed colors and icons

Estimated time: 100 hours
Estimated cost: 6800 EUR

After delivery, PKT.chat maintainers will be able to install and test an Android App that sends and receives messages to the [pkt.chat](http://pkt.chat) server, as well as receiving push notifications.

### Milestone 4

#### PKT-branded iOS App

At this step we will have an unsigned IPA file that we can distribute for testing which is securely connected to the Mattermost proxy server and which uses PKT-themed colors and icons.

Estimated time: 100 hours
Estimated cost: 6800 EUR

After delivery, PKT.chat maintainers will be able to install and test an iOS App that sends and receives messages to the [pkt.chat](http://pkt.chat) server, as well as receiving push notifications.
