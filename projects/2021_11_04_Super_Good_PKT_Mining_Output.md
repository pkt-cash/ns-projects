## Project summary

Currently PKT miners receive a lot of confusing error messages.  These messages may or may not have a negative impact on mining performance, but, they create a negative perception of PKT.  Miners may think PKT is an immature blockchain with buggy code and an unorganized team.  This discourages community development, network effects and the likelihood that PKT fulfills its mission to democratize the internet.  The scope of this project is to make the mining user experience, specifically around error messages, be clean and professional, and to have the error messages available to engineers that wish to double click on and troubleshoot them.

In addition to adding value by completing this project, our goal is to build a reputation of integrity and quality execution with the PKT community.  Accordingly, we identified this project as one that is relatively low risk and narrow in scope.
