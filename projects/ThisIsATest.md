## Success criteria

> **Instructions:** Explain how the Network Steward should evaluate the success or failure of your project as a bullet list. Some examples of criteria might be:
> * Capability of cjdns nodes to interconnect over wifi without any specific configuration

> these milestones in order to justify what has already been done.

### Milestone 0 (Kickoff)

> **Instructions:** Document anything which you did on the project before the project began, any prototypes,
> mockups, planning or useful work which was done. This should correspond to the **Pre-project effort**
> defined at the beginning of the document.
>
> Then explain how much PKT must be provided at the beginning of the project. **NOTE:** Projects which ask for larger advances with less pre-project work will be regarded as more risky, for details see the [acceptance_process](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects/blob/master/acceptance_process.md).

After the project is accepted, the Network Steward will pay XXX PKT

### Milestone 1

#### Success criteria
