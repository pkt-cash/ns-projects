## Project summary ##
Create a cjdns wireguard for encryption in the PKT network. PKT ecosystem includes a special broadcasting network and a protocol, that can be used for building decentralized VPN services and Web 3.0. PKT team is going to create a worldwide online community of PKT protocol adopters and unite all supporters of decentralized web. Also PKT is a bandwidth market based on cjdns protocol, which rewards its members for bandwidth delegation. 

## Project deliverables ##
This project will deliver:
* Contributions to existing software: https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns
Note on delivery: the team 
* would plan to set up the software development process in two week long spring
* would be ready to discuss the current spring results and plans for next sprint every two weeks with the Stewards and other stakeholders



## Success criteria ##

Verify that wireguard encryption mechanism is complete and ready to launch.

## Milestones ##
Creation of cjdns encryption wireguard. Here are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

### Milestone 0: Kickoff
At the beginning of the project, the Network Steward will pay out 8M of PKT to the applicant.

### Milestone 1: Modification of cjdns ##
Modification of cjdns build to allow inclusion of Rust code in the codebase - accepted in mainline cjdns

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 8M of PKT will be paid out.

### Milestone 2: Demo cjdns connection ##
Version of cjdns using cloudflare BoringTUN based WireGuard encryption, demo two cjdns instances connecting - accepted in mainline cjdns. Features expected to be completed include:

* New version number for cjdns which uses BoringTUN when possible, falls back on CryptoAuth for communicating with older cjdns instances

Upon the completion of this milestone, a report will be made for the Network Steward and if the Network Steward accepts this report, 8M of PKT will be paid out.
