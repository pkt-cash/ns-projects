## Project summary

Network Steward Team:

This is Proposal 1 of 4 related proposals we are submitting.  High level summaries are below.  These projects roll up into what we see as our core contribution: i) building PKT Network’s exciting and revolutionary technology and ii) enabling success through managing risk (cybersecurity, reputation, compliance).  We have done our due diligence and are confident we will deliver on all submitted projects.  We would be honored to be awarded any combination.  To make reviewing our proposals easier the following sections are identical across all 6 proposals: Short Term Impact, Long Term Impact, Risk Management, Hazard Control.

Proposal 1: Secure Matchmaking Web App.  Solves the following problems: i) enables matchmaking for cross chain atomic swaps, ii) automates and simplifies and security hardens recently hacked escrow, iii) Hardens platform security.  CEX’s represent a massive web3 vulnerability.  Subsequent iterations could be leveraged to protect community member funds with a hardened interface.  We believe we can extend this concept to harden other interfaces throughout the platform.  We believe we can bring our secure code practices to other parts of the platform.

Proposal 2: Atomic Swap Phase 1 - Cross chain command line HTLC swap between PKT and BTC.  Atomic swaps are strategic throughout many aspects of the roadmap.  Right to cancel to manage unknown unknowns for both Network Steward and AIoT Punks.  If an unknown unknown comes up and we are unable to deliver we will cancel at no cost to the Network Steward.  

Proposal 3: Atomic Swap Phase 2 - Cross chain electrum wallet HTLC swaps between PKT and BTC.  Atomic swaps are strategic throughout many aspects of the roadmap.  Right to cancel to manage unknown unknowns for both Network Steward and AIoT Punks after completing Proposal 2 and prior to starting Proposal 3.  

Proposal 4: Atomic Swap Phase 3 - Cross chain lightning network HTLC swaps between PKT and BTC.  Includes BoltzExchange port to Secure Matchmaking Web App (Proposal 1).  Right to cancel to manage unknown unknowns for both Network Steward and AIoT Punks after completing Proposal 3 and prior to starting Proposal 4.

## Project deliverables


MVP Web Application Peer-to-Peer Exchange:

1) Secure by Design Web Application

1.1) Crypto 

1.1.1) Secured by escrow multisig or atomic swap depending on which projects are approved

1.2) Web App plus Database

1.2.1) Deliver a minimum of 80% of 39 security requirements listed in Tanya Janka’s book on web application security (See below Appendix A  -  Web App Secure Code Requirements)

2) Matchmaking

2.1) Direct match: scan QR Code or enter Public Address

2.2) Table with bids and offers sorted by most competitive prices

2.3) Ability to sort and filter by deal size, price, address 

2.4) Encrypted Chat

3) Multisig wallet escrow requiring 2 of 3 signatures to complete transaction (Eth or PKT based - Following detail is for Eth)

3.1) PKT buyer sends USDT/C to wallet and pays gas for transaction

3.2) PKT seller confirms funds are in wallet, sends PKT to PKT buyer and signs transaction for receipt of USDT/C

3.3) PKT buyer receives PKT and signs and signs transaction to send USDT/C to PKT seller.  PKT seller receives agreed upon USDT/C less gas to send funds from multisig wallet

3.4) Should there be a dispute, both parties present their case to the dispute resolution board

3.5) Dispute resolution board listens to evidence. If further detail is needed they request further detail.  Once the dispute resolution board has reached their decision by way for majority vote, the executor distributes the funds accordingly.

4) 1 year software support and cloud hosting

5) Governance - WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE ETHICAL CONCERNS OF THE NETWORK STEWARD AND ARE WILLING TO MAKE SWEEPING CHANGES - THE FOLLOWING IS A DRAFT. WE WILL OFFER THE NETWORK STEWARD AND OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND UPDATE ACCORDINGLY

5.1) Governance will evolve based on community/NS feedback and through iterative learning

5.2) Governance will originally be centralized with the goal of becoming decentralized

5.3) Original board consists of existing escrow team: i) @BoukjeV, ii) @Caztiel, iii) @adonisgaitatzis

5.4) Transaction Fees 

5.4.1) Every time money flows into or out of a peer-to-peer exchange transactional multisig wallet a 1% transaction fee will be collected.  

5.4.2) With the exception of disputed transactions this results in the PKT buyer and PKT seller each paying 1%.

5.4.3) Transaction fees are divided into three categories as follows: i) ¼ is allocated to the active executor, ii) ½ is allocated to the “Regulatory Risk Management Fund”, iii) ¼ is allocated to the Cybersecurity Risk Management Fund.  Each is controlled by a multisig wallet with 2 of 3 signatures required to complete a transaction.

5.4.3.1) The active executor receives compensation for their service as outlined in the governance section.

5.4.3.2) The Regulatory Risk Management Fund will have governance that emulates that of the Network Steward.  It stores “Paid Up Capital” as a logical defense against regulatory attacks. It encourages community driven regulatory compliance projects.  Potential use cases: compliance hardening initiatives and acting as a buffer should regulators come after PKT Network.  Could be funded through our separately submitted Proposal 6, through web app transaction fees or both.

5.4.3.3) The Cybersecurity Risk Management Fund will have governance that emulates that of the Network Steward.  It encourages community driven cybersecurity projects.  Potential use cases: bug bounties, patches, incident response, victim compensation, security operations, and other security related initiatives.  Could be funded through our separately submitted Proposal 5, through web app transaction fees or both.

5.4.4) Dispute Resolution

5.4.4.1) The board will elect a dispute resolution executor for a defined period of time.  By default there will be a rotation among the board members with a new member taking the role each week.

5.4.4.2) The dispute resolution executor funds accumulate over the course of the term executor’s term and are sent to the executor’s wallet after the completion of his/her subsequent term.  The intention is that every transaction has funds at stake.

5.4.4.3) A dispute resolution requires a majority vote: 2 of 3 votes.

5.4.4.4) The executor is expected to take action consistent with the majority vote.  

5.4.4.5) Should the executor act outside the majority vote then the executor funds will be distributed as follows: 50% to the paid up capital fund and 50% to the cybersecurity fund.

SHORT TERM IMPACT

Will this project facilitate the use of PKT for micro-payments?
Atomic swaps and the lightning network are critical components for PKT’s micro-payments roadmap. 

Does this project align with the PKT bandwidth market strategy?
Security, compliance and reputation risks are necessary to manage for PKT to fulfill on its bandwidth market strategy.

Will this project help PKT to distinguish itself from other blockchains?
PKT will continue to build a reputation of integrity and execution.  These factors tend to attract A Players.

Does this project provide a piece of infrastructure which is considered necessary for any blockchain?
Insecure code and software interfaces are 2 major categories of security vulnerabilities for blockchains in general.  
PKT has an escrow system that is inefficient and was recently hacked.  Solving a data breach scenario is critical to any blockchain.  
Unclear regulator guidance is a risk blockchains in general face.





LONG TERM IMPACT
 
PKT Network and its community are rapidly executing on the roadmap, have risk visibility (Cybersecurity, Reputation and Compliance) and are making risk informed decisions.
 
The PKT Community leverages AIoT Punk’s Atomic Swap and Lightning Network contributions for multiple strategic platform components: pktd, Anode VPN, TokenStrike, Wallets and more. The PKT Community leverages AIoT Punk’s Secure Matchmaking Web App contribution to build secure software interfaces and API’s across the platform.  PKT Network is building two separate funds, that are governed with integrity governance, to confidently manage cybersecurity and regulatory risks.  PKT has come to count on AIoT Punks for some of it’s most challenging projects and are confident they will fulfill on their word.  
 
Based off risk visibility, PKT’s level of risk tolerance and community culture, community members and leaders make risk-informed decisions increasing PKT’s likelihood of success.  The community understands their risk posture, are clear on their desired state and have a plan to get there.  
 
The PKT community is thriving and growing exponentially.  The Network Steward has an abundance of high value add projects to choose from.  PKT Network brings internet freedom to billions of users.  
 
Will this project help advance the separation of "network administrator" from "infrastructure operator" roles?
By making risk aware decisions and having a solid reputation, the community will likely make better decisions with improved outcomes, in particular towards PKT’s fundamental value proposition.

Will this project provide key infrastructure/institutions necessary to the emergence of a healthy bandwidth market ecosystem?
Starting with atomic swaps and a secure cross chain atomic swap and escrow matchmaking webapp we will build secure and compliant infrastructure that is consistent with your level of risk tolerance.

Does this project bypass a tragedy-of-the-commons problem which blocks the natural emergence of a piece of key infrastructure?
Having a solid reputation of integrity and execution and offering platform risk visibility are necessary ingredients for the Network Steward to attract an abundance of quality projects.


RISK MANAGEMENT

How evenly is the effort spaced over the milestones of the project ?
Each proposal represents a bite sized project. Some of the proposals are stand alone, some of them are prerequisites for others.  We have broken up our milestones into small chunks and payments.

How evenly is the payment spaced over the milestones of the project?
Consistent with spacing out our deliverables, our payments are evenly spaced out.

How well did the applicant specify success criteria for the project?

Our success criteria are clearly defined.

To what extent are the risks defined and planned for in the project proposal?

We have put a risk management clause into our most ambitious proposals - Proposals 2, 3 and 4 (Atomic Swaps and the Lightning Network). These proposals on each other and will be done in order. If we uncover unknown unknowns and we are unable to fulfill on the current terms, then we have the right to cancel or propose an alternative to the Network Steward.  The Network Steward also has a right to cancel before we begin each of these projects.  If we cancel there will be no cost to the network steward. 

To what extent are the difficulties and potential blockers moved to the early parts of the project?

Team structure for approaching technical problems: i) Rex reads hundreds of technical books and simplifies the high level mechanics of cutting edge technology, ii) 

Frank is an expert coder and explores the details of which options are viable for him to execute, iii) HughJohn has extensive software project management experience and brings both creative ideas and rational judgment, iv) Sunny is our technical advisor and makes sure our attention is directed effectively and efficiently.

We have made a considerable effort to define our problem statements and solutions according to community feedback.

For each proposal we have very clearly walked through and agreed upon our deliverables.

Proposal 1 - Secure Matchmaking Web App: Frank wrote the backend code for this website (https://www.supreme.de) and he will use memory safe Ruby On Rails for our project.  I put together a 49 point security requirements structure based off my professional experience and https://www.amazon.com/Alice-Bob-Learn-Application-Security. Web hosting and front end design are fairly straight forward. We can further harden in subsequent iterations.

Proposals 2 - 4: After engaging with CJD, I read Mastering the Lightning Network by Andreas Antonopoulos, put the high level pieces together and discussed with Frank.  Frank found the specific solutions.  We also put a right to cancel clause to reduce risk as outlined above.

Proposals 5 and 6: We leveraged governance concepts from the Network Steward to manage conflicts of interest such that we could encourage community creativity and contribution to managing two important categories of risk.

What evidence is there that the project owner is capable of delivering?

We have successfully completed one of our earlier submissions to the Network Steward in advance of this submission deadline to demonstrate our ability to deliver software solutions to the Pkt Ecosystem. See here for the external filter application for the miner:
		https://github.com/FrankBuss/pktannfilter
	and integrated in the packetcrypt_rs software:
https://github.com/FrankBuss/packetcrypt_rs/tree/better-logging

We have engaged with multiple members of the community. We believe this has given both the Network Steward and AIoT Punks an opportunity to explore each other’s strengths and weaknesses, willingness and ability to deliver and commitment to integrity.

Please review our team member bios to understand our backgrounds.



HAZARD CONTROL
 
To what extent is the project safe from any real or perceived conflicts of interest with the NS team?

We do not see any conflicts of interest with the Network Steward team.  

We understand and respect that the Network Steward is committed to being objective and fair.  As with any project it is important to conduct due diligence to understand the problem and to scope the solution.  This is particularly important when we are both making commitments up front.  We conducted professional due diligence with various community members including NS team members. 

To what extent are the results of this project equally advantageous to all participants in the PKT ecosystem ?

This project:

Has a relatively small and clearly defined scope and low risk.

Contributes to strategic technology the benefits the PKT ecosystem.

Provides PKT Tangible Steps Towards Understanding & Managing Cybersecurity Risk. 

In general, blockchains are 10X secure: everything they touch is vulnerable.  

Crypto cybercrime is growing exponentially.  One report states that 79% of cybersecurity incidents in 18 months were fueled by crypto.  Another report states that there were more than 30 reported attacks on crypto exchanges, involving $3 billion in losses, during 2021 alone.  

Cybersecurity financial risks.  A cyberattack can be the end for an emerging project.  60% of small companies close within 6 months of being hacked.  A $200M flash loan attack killed an emerging defi project, Pancake Bunny.  Each attack impacts a project’s reputation.

Cybersecurity compliance risks.  There are several regulators that relate to cybersecurity.  Amazon was fined EUR 746M for failing to comply with GDPR privacy regulations.  Equifax was fined $575M for failing to patch a critical vulnerability.  Home Depot was fined $200M after it’s 2014 data breach.

Potential strategies to mitigate cybersecurity risk: i) become compliant with NIST or another relevant cybersecurity framework, ii) intentionally build a cybersecurity program that aligns with PKT Network’s culture and return/risk goals.  

Any combination of our proposals will transparently provide concrete steps towards implementing a cybersecurity program. 

Provides PKT Tangible Steps Towards Understanding & Managing Regulatory Risk:  
“Regulators are coming” is the theme we see in the headlines. This is driven by the following 2021 activity: i) the crypto market cap tripled to an all time high of $2.5 Trillion which was followed by a 40% fall, ii) the market cap of stable coins quadrupled to $120M, iii) there were a large number of high profile cases alleging fraud and money laundering.  

Although we do not know where the regulations will land, we have several data points to work with.  

The bigger PKT gets the more regulators will pay attention.

PKT has an interesting challenge. In addition to dealing with the financial regulators (FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, IRS, individual states among others in the US), it also needs to navigate a fight with monopolistic Internet Services Providers and relevant regulators (FCC and others in the US).  Analogous regulators globally. 

The ISP / FCC fight will likely be more difficult to navigate.  They could leverage other regulators to achieve their goals.  As is classic through history, entrenched monopolies tend to play dirty when they are threatened.  Tim Wu’s “The Master Switch” does an outstanding job outlining AT&T questionable tactics it used to maintain power.

Potential strategies to mitigate regulatory risk: i) be seen as an opportunity and not as a threat (China to the rest of the world in the 1990’s and 2000’s.), ii) become compliant or partially compliant with an action plan to relevant regulators, iii) restrict exposure to crypto friendly jurisdictions, iv) become powerful enough such that the regulators’ best choice is to negotiate fairly.

As outlined in the deliverables, this project transparently provides concrete steps towards reducing regulatory risk.

Provides PKT Tangible Steps Towards Understanding & Managing Reputation Risk. 

Platforms need network effects to win.  Nurturing possibility with a community is delicate.  Community members have many options where they can allocate their time and money.  We nurture our reputation, we have a shot at building our community and winning.  We compromise our reputation; we lose our community; we lose.

Culture impacts an organization’s ability to manage its reputation.

A cybersecurity breach or regulatory attack, when managed poorly, can have a catastrophically negative impact on an entity’s reputation.

Any combination of our proposals will transparently provide concrete steps towards implementing a cybersecurity program. 

To what extent does the proposal structure the project such that success will be more advantageous to the applicant than failure?

We have evenly spaced out our milestones, deliverables and payments.  Fulfilling on our word offers us our greatest upside.

To what extent does the project control the risk of arbitrage profit opportunity for the applicant ?

We have priced our deliverables in a stable currency.

At each milestone we will request payment in accordance with the current price of PKT, and we will declare the price with the milestone report.

We plan to sell PKT, even if only to ourselves, at the market price. When we make a trade we will declare it via a pull request to the NS so that nobody can accuse us of insider dealing with ourselves: e.g. back-dating the transaction to a time when the coin was low.

Did the applicant declare and control for any potential conflicts of interest?

We are not aware of any conflicts of interest.

APPENDIX A - WEB APP SECURE CODE REQUIREMENTS

Encrypt all appropriate data at rest (while in the database)

Encrypt all data in transit (on its way to and from the user, the database, an API, etc.).

Trust no one: validate (and sanitize if specialize circumstances apply) all data, even from your own database.

Encode (and escape if need be) all output.

Scan all libraries and third-party components for known vulnerabilities before use, and regularly after use (new vulnerabilities and versions are released all the time).

Use all applicable security headers.

Use appropriate secure cookie settings.

Classify and label all data that your application will store, collect, or create.

Hash and salt all user passwords. Make the salt at least 28 characters.

Store all application secrets in a secret store.

Ensure all accounts used within the application are service accounts (not a human being’s account).

Have all people on your team use password managers and never reuse passwords.

Turn on MFA for all important accounts.

Do not force password changes on a schedule, but only after a breach or suspicious activity.

Only allow public-facing (internet) sites to be accessible via HTTPS. Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Ideally this would be applied to both internal and external applications.

Ensure you are using the latest version of TLS for encryption (currently 1.3).

Never hard code anything. Ever.

Never put sensitive information in comments. This includes connection strings and passwords; those belong in a secret store.

Use the security features within your framework; for instance, cryptography/encryption, session management features, or input sanitization functions. Never write your own if your framework provides them.

Use only the latest version (or the one before) of your framework and keep it up to date. Technical debt = security debt.

Probably not relevant. If performing a file upload, ensure you are following the advice from OWASP for this highly risky activity. This includes scanning all uploaded files with a scanner such as AssemblyLine, available for free from the Communications Security Establishment of Canada (CSE).

Ensure all errors are logged (but do not log sensitive information), and if any security errors happen, trigger an alert.

Ensure all input validation (and sanitization) is performed server side, using an approved list or accepted list (not a block list) approach.

Ensure security testing is performed on your application before being released

Perform threat modeling on your application before being released.

Perform code review (specifically of security functions) on your application before being released.

Ensure the application catches all errors and fails safe or fails closed (never fail into an unknown state).

Ensure all errors provide generic information to the user, never information from a stack trace, query fail, or other technically specific information.

Define specifics on role-based access in the project requirements.

Ensure specifics on authentication methods and identity systems are defined in the project requirements.

Only use parameterized queries, never inline SQL/NOSQL.

Do not pass variables that are of any importance in the URL parameters.

Ensure the application enforces the security principle of least privilege, especially in regard to accessing the database and APIs.

Minimize your attack surface whenever possible.

Allow users to cut and paste into the password field, which will allow for use of password managers. Disable password autocomplete features in browsers, to ensure users do not save their passwords into the browser.

Disable caching on pages that contain sensitive information. While the Cache HTTP header is not technically a security header, it can be used to enforce this requirement.

Ensure passwords for your application’s users are long, but not necessarily complex. The longer the better; encourage use of passphrases.

Do not force users to change their passwords after a certain amount of time, unless a breach is suspected.

Verify that new user’s passwords have not previously been in a breach by using a service designed for such a task.
