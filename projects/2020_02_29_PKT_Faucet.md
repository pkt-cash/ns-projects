## Project summary

PKT Faucet is a website where users complete an easy task and are rewarded a small amount of PKT cash, resulting in increased awareness and engagement from the new users of the PKT network.


## 1. Project Relevance to the PKT Network

PKT Faucet is a reward system in the form of a website that dispenses small amounts of PKT cash in exchange for completing a trivial and easy task. This catchy entertainment is expected to motivate users to experience increased curiosity for the PKT network, resulting in higher awareness and engagement to participate in the network.

Faucets originally [started in 2010](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/01/03/five-years-of-bitcoin-in-one-post/) to [spread the adoption of Bitcoin](https://99bitcoins.com/best-bitcoin-faucets/). The [first Bitcoin Faucet](https://web.archive.org/web/20100703032414/http://freebitcoins.appspot.com/) was developed by Gavin Andresen, and it used to dispense 5 Bitcoins to each user in exchange for completing an easy captcha. On the first BTC faucet website, Gavin Andresen wrote ─
> _**What's the catch?** 
<br> No catch-- I want Bitcoin to be successful, so I created this little service to give you a few coins to start with. 
<br> -- [gavin](https://web.archive.org/web/20100703032414/http://freebitcoins.appspot.com/)_

─ and we want PKT to be successful too.

## 2. Project Deliverables
The key deliverable will create new software for the front-end and back-end of the PKT Faucet website.

### 2.1 How it works

The following steps outline the broad user story:

* **Step 1. Sign Up**
<br> This stage is an opportunity to engage new users by explaining to them how to create a wallet. If the user already has a PKT wallet, they can input their already existing address. We may need to ask users to sign up to avoid having one user inputting multiple wallet addresses the same day.

* **Step 2. Complete a task**
<br> Users complete an easy and trivial task. This task will be defined during the development stage of the PKT Faucet, based on several factors such as testing the user interaction with the task, simplifying the programming, and increasing safety and robustness. Examples of possible tasks include completing a captcha, or clicking a button 100 times.

* **Step 3. Reward and waiting-timer activation**
<br> When the user finishes the task, their wallet is rewarded a small amount of PKT cash to-be defined, for example, 1 PKT. When the task is completed, the user is also put on hold before they can complete the task again. The waiting-period length will be defined during the development stage, and tentatively we estimate that the hold might be 24 hours.

### 2.3 Development overview

* **Website:** The deliverables are a new website. The website domain will be defined during the development stage.

* **License:** The software will be available under the [ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license. All artistic non-software assets will be available under the [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

* **Mantainer:** The maintainer of this software will be: Jonathan Owens

* **Outbound links:** The website may include banners linking to other resources related to the PKT network, such as [Gridfinity](https://www.gridfinity.com/) or a wallet service.

* **Language:** We will define the programming language during the development stage. We estimate that, most likely, the majority of the development will be PHP and HTML.

* **Open source:** The software will be hosted on https://github.com/pkt-cash, if the network steward wishes it so.

* **Safety:** Keeping safety in mind, we propose that the Steward fund the operation stage of the PKT Faucet on a monthly drip basis of 200,000 PKT per month. This way, if the PKT Faucet safety is compromised, the amount of PKT at risk is smaller, compared to funding the complete operation of the PKT Faucet annually. We welcome the Steward to request a different funding-drip time period at your discretion if the monthly period is not suitable.

### 2.4 Milestones
The following are milestones for the progress of the project by which the network steward can evaluate the success of the project.

* [ ] **M0 - Kickoff**
<br> At the kickoff of the project, the network steward will grant 3 million PKT to the applicants, and the project will begin.

* [ ] **M1 - User-task & Reward**
<br>Milestone 1 will focus on developing the minimum features to complete a user-task and get rewarded PKT cash. Upon the completion of Milestone 1, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward. The network steward shall pay 3 million PKT for the completion of this milestone.

* [ ] **M2 - Complete version**
<br> Milestone 2 will be achieved when all target features listed in section 2.1 are developed and can be used used in a website domain. Upon completion of Milestone 2, a report will be written, and the applicant will seek approval from the network steward. Upon approval, payment of 10 million PKT will be issued. At this point, the development stage of the project will conclude.

* [ ] **Mx - Ongoing operation and maintenance**
<br> We will need an ongoing incoming flow of 200,000 PKT per month to fund the PKT cash given away in rewards to the users, and keep the website active and operational. We welcome the Steward to request a different funding-drip time period at your discretion if the monthly period is not desirable, and we are also open to accepting a one-lump sum of 2,400,000 PKT to cover 12 months. 

### 2.5 Team qualifications
* **Jonathan Owens** is a blockchain entrepreneur since the early stages of the technology. He has founded several successful companies in the space, including [Narwhal](https://narwhal.ai/) and [Gridfinity](http://gridfinity.com/).

* **Leonardo Robiglio** (MBA, Babson School of Business) has a track record of driving growth and innovation in prior leadership roles in technology at Toyota, and as CEO of Hostel Point Co., and was previously an engineer at Peugeot-Citroën Automobile.

## 3. Success Criteria
* At least one successful independent reward of PKT.
* At least 90% achievement of the described features.

## 4. Payments
Each payments shall be distributed to the following address: `pkt_address_to-be_defined_1`

## 5. Legal
The applicant understands that the network steward is not a legal entity, and no part of this project constitutes any form of legal agreement. The applicant accepts that the network steward exists thanks to the effort of volunteers, and the applicant has no reasonable expectation of any action, payment, or communication from the network steward at any time. For their part, the applicant has no binding commitment or obligation at any time as a result of their participation in this project.
