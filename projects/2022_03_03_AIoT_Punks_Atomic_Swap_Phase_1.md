## Project summary

Network Steward Team:

This is Proposal 2 of 4 related proposals we are submitting.  High level summaries are below.  These projects roll up into what we see as our core contribution: i) building PKT Network’s exciting and revolutionary technology and ii) enabling success through managing risk (cybersecurity, reputation, compliance).  We have done our due diligence and are confident we will deliver on all submitted projects.  We would be honored to be awarded any combination.  To make reviewing our proposals easier the following sections are identical across all 6 proposals: Short Term Impact, Long Term Impact, Risk Management, Hazard Control.

Proposal 1: Secure Matchmaking Web App.  Solves the following problems: i) enables matchmaking for cross chain atomic swaps, ii) automates and simplifies and security hardens recently hacked escrow, iii) Hardens platform security.  CEX’s represent a massive web3 vulnerability.  Subsequent iterations could be leveraged to protect community member funds with a hardened interface.  We believe we can extend this concept to harden other interfaces throughout the platform.  We believe we can bring our secure code practices to other parts of the platform.

Proposal 2: Atomic Swap Phase 1 - Cross chain command line HTLC swap between PKT and BTC.  Atomic swaps are strategic throughout many aspects of the roadmap.  Right to cancel to manage unknown unknowns for both Network Steward and AIoT Punks.  If an unknown unknown comes up and we are unable to deliver we will cancel at no cost to the Network Steward.  

Proposal 3: Atomic Swap Phase 2 - Cross chain electrum wallet HTLC swaps between PKT and BTC.  Atomic swaps are strategic throughout many aspects of the roadmap.  Right to cancel to manage unknown unknowns for both Network Steward and AIoT Punks after completing Proposal 2 and prior to starting Proposal 3.  

Proposal 4: Atomic Swap Phase 3 - Cross chain lightning network HTLC swaps between PKT and BTC.  Includes BoltzExchange port to Secure Matchmaking Web App (Proposal 1).  Right to cancel to manage unknown unknowns for both Network Steward and AIoT Punks after completing Proposal 3 and prior to starting Proposal 4.

## Project deliverables

DELIVERABLES

A command line program written in Rust, which implements the HTLC process as described here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0199.mediawiki
The program allows the following actions:
create the preimage and digest
create the HTLC script and P2SH address (with the rawtransactions RPCs of the nodes, if possible, otherwise we extend the RPCs first)
send money for both parties
reveal the preimage of a HTLC transaction by providing the transaction ID
recover money in case of a timeout
The program requires a RPC connection to a Bitcoin full node, and a PKT full node.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

Successful HTLC transfer between BTC/PKT in both directions, and unsuccessful transfer in both directions, with money recovery after the timeout, with the command line program. Tested on the testnets of PKT and BTC.

## Milestones

### Milestone 0 (Kickoff)

Success Criteria

1) Form team

2) Define problem statement and proposed solution with PKT community members

3) Draft governance for review and feedback

4) Draft secure code requirements

5) Submit proposal

#### Payout
After the project is accepted, the Network Steward will pay the PKT equivalent of 2,016 USDC (1/5 of the project budget)

### Milestone 1

Success Criteria

1) Successful HTLC transfer between BTC/PKT in both directions, and unsuccessful transfer in both directions, with money recovery after the timeout, with the Electrum wallets. Tested on the testnets of PKT and BTC.


#### Payout
After a report is delivered on this milestone and it is approved by the NS, the NS will send the PKT equivalent of 8,064 USDC (4/5 of the project budget)




SHORT TERM IMPACT

Will this project facilitate the use of PKT for micro-payments?
Atomic swaps and the lightning network are critical components for PKT’s micro-payments roadmap. 

Does this project align with the PKT bandwidth market strategy?
Security, compliance and reputation risks are necessary to manage for PKT to fulfill on its bandwidth market strategy.

Will this project help PKT to distinguish itself from other blockchains?
PKT will continue to build a reputation of integrity and execution.  These factors tend to attract A Players.

Does this project provide a piece of infrastructure which is considered necessary for any blockchain?
Insecure code and software interfaces are 2 major categories of security vulnerabilities for blockchains in general.  
PKT has an escrow system that is inefficient and was recently hacked.  Solving a data breach scenario is critical to any blockchain.  
Unclear regulator guidance is a risk blockchains in general face.





LONG TERM IMPACT
 
PKT Network and its community are rapidly executing on the roadmap, have risk visibility (Cybersecurity, Reputation and Compliance) and are making risk informed decisions.
 
The PKT Community leverages AIoT Punk’s Atomic Swap and Lightning Network contributions for multiple strategic platform components: pktd, Anode VPN, TokenStrike, Wallets and more. The PKT Community leverages AIoT Punk’s Secure Matchmaking Web App contribution to build secure software interfaces and API’s across the platform.  PKT Network is building two separate funds, that are governed with integrity governance, to confidently manage cybersecurity and regulatory risks.  PKT has come to count on AIoT Punks for some of it’s most challenging projects and are confident they will fulfill on their word.  
 
Based off risk visibility, PKT’s level of risk tolerance and community culture, community members and leaders make risk-informed decisions increasing PKT’s likelihood of success.  The community understands their risk posture, are clear on their desired state and have a plan to get there.  
 
The PKT community is thriving and growing exponentially.  The Network Steward has an abundance of high value add projects to choose from.  PKT Network brings internet freedom to billions of users.  
 
Will this project help advance the separation of "network administrator" from "infrastructure operator" roles?
By making risk aware decisions and having a solid reputation, the community will likely make better decisions with improved outcomes, in particular towards PKT’s fundamental value proposition.

Will this project provide key infrastructure/institutions necessary to the emergence of a healthy bandwidth market ecosystem?
Starting with atomic swaps and a secure cross chain atomic swap and escrow matchmaking webapp we will build secure and compliant infrastructure that is consistent with your level of risk tolerance.

Does this project bypass a tragedy-of-the-commons problem which blocks the natural emergence of a piece of key infrastructure?
Having a solid reputation of integrity and execution and offering platform risk visibility are necessary ingredients for the Network Steward to attract an abundance of quality projects.


RISK MANAGEMENT

How evenly is the effort spaced over the milestones of the project ?
Each proposal represents a bite sized project. Some of the proposals are stand alone, some of them are prerequisites for others.  We have broken up our milestones into small chunks and payments.

How evenly is the payment spaced over the milestones of the project?
Consistent with spacing out our deliverables, our payments are evenly spaced out.

How well did the applicant specify success criteria for the project?

Our success criteria are clearly defined.

To what extent are the risks defined and planned for in the project proposal?

We have put a risk management clause into our most ambitious proposals - Proposals 2, 3 and 4 (Atomic Swaps and the Lightning Network). These proposals on each other and will be done in order. If we uncover unknown unknowns and we are unable to fulfill on the current terms, then we have the right to cancel or propose an alternative to the Network Steward.  The Network Steward also has a right to cancel before we begin each of these projects.  If we cancel there will be no cost to the network steward. 

To what extent are the difficulties and potential blockers moved to the early parts of the project?

Team structure for approaching technical problems: i) Rex reads hundreds of technical books and simplifies the high level mechanics of cutting edge technology, ii) 

Frank is an expert coder and explores the details of which options are viable for him to execute, iii) HughJohn has extensive software project management experience and brings both creative ideas and rational judgment, iv) Sunny is our technical advisor and makes sure our attention is directed effectively and efficiently.

We have made a considerable effort to define our problem statements and solutions according to community feedback.

For each proposal we have very clearly walked through and agreed upon our deliverables.

Proposal 1 - Secure Matchmaking Web App: Frank wrote the backend code for this website (https://www.supreme.de) and he will use memory safe Ruby On Rails for our project.  I put together a 49 point security requirements structure based off my professional experience and https://www.amazon.com/Alice-Bob-Learn-Application-Security. Web hosting and front end design are fairly straight forward. We can further harden in subsequent iterations.

Proposals 2 - 4: After engaging with CJD, I read Mastering the Lightning Network by Andreas Antonopoulos, put the high level pieces together and discussed with Frank.  Frank found the specific solutions.  We also put a right to cancel clause to reduce risk as outlined above.

Proposals 5 and 6: We leveraged governance concepts from the Network Steward to manage conflicts of interest such that we could encourage community creativity and contribution to managing two important categories of risk.

What evidence is there that the project owner is capable of delivering?

We have successfully completed one of our earlier submissions to the Network Steward in advance of this submission deadline to demonstrate our ability to deliver software solutions to the Pkt Ecosystem. See here for the external filter application for the miner:
		https://github.com/FrankBuss/pktannfilter
	and integrated in the packetcrypt_rs software:
https://github.com/FrankBuss/packetcrypt_rs/tree/better-logging

We have engaged with multiple members of the community. We believe this has given both the Network Steward and AIoT Punks an opportunity to explore each other’s strengths and weaknesses, willingness and ability to deliver and commitment to integrity.

Please review our team member bios to understand our backgrounds.



HAZARD CONTROL
 
To what extent is the project safe from any real or perceived conflicts of interest with the NS team?

We do not see any conflicts of interest with the Network Steward team.  

We understand and respect that the Network Steward is committed to being objective and fair.  As with any project it is important to conduct due diligence to understand the problem and to scope the solution.  This is particularly important when we are both making commitments up front.  We conducted professional due diligence with various community members including NS team members. 

To what extent are the results of this project equally advantageous to all participants in the PKT ecosystem ?

This project:

Has a relatively small and clearly defined scope and low risk.

Contributes to strategic technology the benefits the PKT ecosystem.

Provides PKT Tangible Steps Towards Understanding & Managing Cybersecurity Risk. 

In general, blockchains are 10X secure: everything they touch is vulnerable.  

Crypto cybercrime is growing exponentially.  One report states that 79% of cybersecurity incidents in 18 months were fueled by crypto.  Another report states that there were more than 30 reported attacks on crypto exchanges, involving $3 billion in losses, during 2021 alone.  

Cybersecurity financial risks.  A cyberattack can be the end for an emerging project.  60% of small companies close within 6 months of being hacked.  A $200M flash loan attack killed an emerging defi project, Pancake Bunny.  Each attack impacts a project’s reputation.

Cybersecurity compliance risks.  There are several regulators that relate to cybersecurity.  Amazon was fined EUR 746M for failing to comply with GDPR privacy regulations.  Equifax was fined $575M for failing to patch a critical vulnerability.  Home Depot was fined $200M after it’s 2014 data breach.

Potential strategies to mitigate cybersecurity risk: i) become compliant with NIST or another relevant cybersecurity framework, ii) intentionally build a cybersecurity program that aligns with PKT Network’s culture and return/risk goals.  

Any combination of our proposals will transparently provide concrete steps towards implementing a cybersecurity program. 

Provides PKT Tangible Steps Towards Understanding & Managing Regulatory Risk:  
“Regulators are coming” is the theme we see in the headlines. This is driven by the following 2021 activity: i) the crypto market cap tripled to an all time high of $2.5 Trillion which was followed by a 40% fall, ii) the market cap of stable coins quadrupled to $120M, iii) there were a large number of high profile cases alleging fraud and money laundering.  

Although we do not know where the regulations will land, we have several data points to work with.  

The bigger PKT gets the more regulators will pay attention.

PKT has an interesting challenge. In addition to dealing with the financial regulators (FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, IRS, individual states among others in the US), it also needs to navigate a fight with monopolistic Internet Services Providers and relevant regulators (FCC and others in the US).  Analogous regulators globally. 

The ISP / FCC fight will likely be more difficult to navigate.  They could leverage other regulators to achieve their goals.  As is classic through history, entrenched monopolies tend to play dirty when they are threatened.  Tim Wu’s “The Master Switch” does an outstanding job outlining AT&T questionable tactics it used to maintain power.

Potential strategies to mitigate regulatory risk: i) be seen as an opportunity and not as a threat (China to the rest of the world in the 1990’s and 2000’s.), ii) become compliant or partially compliant with an action plan to relevant regulators, iii) restrict exposure to crypto friendly jurisdictions, iv) become powerful enough such that the regulators’ best choice is to negotiate fairly.

As outlined in the deliverables, this project transparently provides concrete steps towards reducing regulatory risk.

Provides PKT Tangible Steps Towards Understanding & Managing Reputation Risk. 

Platforms need network effects to win.  Nurturing possibility with a community is delicate.  Community members have many options where they can allocate their time and money.  We nurture our reputation, we have a shot at building our community and winning.  We compromise our reputation; we lose our community; we lose.

Culture impacts an organization’s ability to manage its reputation.

A cybersecurity breach or regulatory attack, when managed poorly, can have a catastrophically negative impact on an entity’s reputation.

Any combination of our proposals will transparently provide concrete steps towards implementing a cybersecurity program. 

To what extent does the proposal structure the project such that success will be more advantageous to the applicant than failure?

We have evenly spaced out our milestones, deliverables and payments.  Fulfilling on our word offers us our greatest upside.

To what extent does the project control the risk of arbitrage profit opportunity for the applicant ?

We have priced our deliverables in a stable currency.

At each milestone we will request payment in accordance with the current price of PKT, and we will declare the price with the milestone report.

We plan to sell PKT, even if only to ourselves, at the market price. When we make a trade we will declare it via a pull request to the NS so that nobody can accuse us of insider dealing with ourselves: e.g. back-dating the transaction to a time when the coin was low.

Did the applicant declare and control for any potential conflicts of interest?

We are not aware of any conflicts of interest.
